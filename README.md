# power_bills

This is a console based Power bill calculator that calculates the power bills based on the usage type and the amount of power consumption. HOW WE BUILT THIS APP We created a user friendly interface where the user can input his or her name,then the user is directed to an interface where he or she is to  finally input the amount of power consumed in that certain month. We then implemented a billing algorithm that accurately calculates power bills based on power consumption and the Tarrifs rate  without displaying any errors whatsoever. REQUIREMENTS No special requirements.
